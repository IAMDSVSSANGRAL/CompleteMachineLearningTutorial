## Introduction

Clustering is a fundamental task in unsupervised learning, where the goal is to group a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group (or cluster) are more similar to each other than to those in other groups. This repository provides implementations of three widely-used clustering algorithms along with example scripts to demonstrate their usage.

## Algorithms Included

The repository includes implementations of the following clustering algorithms:
- **K-Means Clustering**: A partitioning method that divides the dataset into K clusters, where each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean.
- **Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering**: A bottom-up clustering method that builds a hierarchy of clusters by merging or splitting them successively.
- **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)**: A density-based clustering method that discovers clusters of varying shapes and sizes and is robust to noise.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Required Python libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`)
